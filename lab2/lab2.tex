\chapter{Qubits and Quantum Circuits}

In classical computing information is encoded in bits, where each bit can have the value 0 or 1. However, in quantum computing `quantum bits' or simply `qubits' are used. These qubits obey the rules of quantum mechanics and allow for information to be processed in new and different ways.

\section{Objectives}
The purpose of this lab is to investigate quantum bits and quantum circuits using `qiskit`. Thus, the following objectives were pursued:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Become familiar with `qiskit'
    \item Implement quantum gates and visualise the state of a qubit through the Bloch sphere
    \item Obtain deeper understanding of quantum operations and quantum circuits basics
\end{itemize}

\section{Methods}
Quantum circuits were implemented and visualised using Python in Jupyter Notebook. Specifically, a library named `qiskit' was used -- an open-source software development kit for working with quantum computers. It provides tools for creating quantum programs and facilitating the simulation of quantum systems with realistic noise models.

To evaluate the accuracy of the analytical predictions from qiskit, the circuits were built on a real quantum computer provided by IBM Quantum. The `IBM Quantum Composer' is an online platform allowing public access to remote quantum computing services.

\section{Results}
Qubits can be represented by 2D vectors, their states are limited to the form:

$$ |q\rangle = \cos{\tfrac{\theta}{2}}|0\rangle + e^{i\phi}\sin{\tfrac{\theta}{2}}|1\rangle $$

This state can be visualized using a `Bloch Sphere', and quantum gates can be used to manipulate this state. These gates can be represented as matrices and as rotations around the Bloch sphere.

In this lab report, Pauli gates, the Hadamard gate and some Multi-qubit gates are analysed.

\subsection{The Pauli Gates}

\subsubsection{The X Gate}
The X gate is represented by the Pauli-X matrix:

$$ X = \begin{bmatrix} 0 & 1 \\ 1 & 0 \end{bmatrix} = |0\rangle\langle1| + |1\rangle\langle0| $$

A circuit was created to determine the effect an X gate has on a qubit. A qubit was initialised in state $|0\rangle$ and passed through an X gate, the circuit diagram of which is shown in Figure \ref{fig:xGate}.

\begin{figure}[h]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=0.3\textwidth]{lab2/images/xGate.png}

    \caption{Circuit diagram of a Pauli-X gate} 
    \label{fig:xGate}
\end{figure}

From the mathematics, it is clear that applying an X gate switches the amplitudes of the states $|0\rangle$ and $|1\rangle$:

$$ X|0\rangle = \begin{bmatrix} 0 & 1 \\ 1 & 0 \end{bmatrix}\begin{bmatrix} 1 \\ 0 \end{bmatrix} = \begin{bmatrix} 0 \\ 1 \end{bmatrix} = |1\rangle \quad\quad\quad\quad
X|1\rangle = \begin{bmatrix} 0 & 1 \\ 1 & 0 \end{bmatrix}\begin{bmatrix} 0 \\ 1 \end{bmatrix} = \begin{bmatrix} 1 \\ 0 \end{bmatrix} = |0\rangle$$

The circuit (shown in Figure \ref{fig:xGate}) was constructed using qiskit, and the states were observed using a Bloch sphere, shown in Figure \ref{fig:bSphereXGate}. The X gate performed a rotation by $\pi$ around the x-axis of the Bloch sphere (the qubit switched to state $|1\rangle$ after being initialised in state~$|0\rangle$).

    \caption{Bloch sphere showing a) the state of the initialised qubit and b) the state of the qubit after being passed through a Pauli-X gate} 
    \label{fig:bSphereXGate}
\end{figure}

\subsubsection{The Y and Z gates}

Similar to the X gate, the Y and Z Pauli matrices can represent the Y and Z gates in quantum circuits. These gates perform rotations by $\pi$ around the y and z-axis of the Bloch sphere, respectively.

$$ Y = \begin{bmatrix} 0 & -i \\ i & 0 \end{bmatrix} = -i|0\rangle\langle1| + i|1\rangle\langle0| $$

$$ Z = \begin{bmatrix} 1 & 0 \\ 0 & -1 \end{bmatrix} = |0\rangle\langle0| - |1\rangle\langle1| $$

A circuit was created with an X and Y gate in series, as shown in Figure \ref{fig:xyGateDiagram}.

\begin{figure}[h]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=0.3\textwidth]{lab2/images/xyGate.png}
    \captionsetup{font = it, labelfont = bf, width=.91\linewidth, justification=centering}
    \caption{Circuit diagram of Pauli-X gate followed by a Pauli-Y gate in series} 
    \label{fig:xyGateDiagram}
\end{figure}

The resultant state was observed through the use of a Bloch sphere. After passing through the circuit described in Figure \ref{fig:xyGateDiagram}, the qubit was found to be in state $|0\rangle$ -- seemingly unchanged from its initialised state -- as shown in Figure \ref{fig:xyGateBloc}.

\begin{figure}[h]
    \centering
    \begin{subfigure}[h]{0.33\textwidth}
        \centering
        \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{lab2/images/bSphX1.png}

        \label{fig:bSphXY1}
    \end{subfigure}
    \hspace{0.2\textwidth}

    \captionsetup{font = it, labelfont = bf, width=.91\linewidth, justification=centering}
    \caption{Bloch sphere showing a) the state of the initialised qubit and b) the state of the qubit after being passed through a Pauli-X gate and a Pauli-Y gate} 
    \label{fig:xyGateBloc}
\end{figure}

After being passed through the circuit, the qubit was found to be in state $|0\rangle$ because:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item The qubit was initialised 
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item in state $|0\rangle$
    \end{enumerate}
    \item The X gate rotated this by $\pi$ around the x-axis of the Bloch sphere
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item resulting with a qubit in state $|1\rangle$
    \end{enumerate}
    \item The Y gate then rotated this by $\pi$ around the y-axis of the Bloch sphere
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item resulting in the qubit being in state $|0\rangle$
    \end{enumerate} 
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{The Hadamard Gate}\label{sec:HZH}
The Hadamard gate (H gate) is a fundamental quantum gate, represented by the following matrix:

$$ H = \tfrac{1}{\sqrt{2}}\begin{bmatrix} 1 & 1 \\ 1 & -1 \end{bmatrix} $$

It allows states to occupy a superposition of $|0\rangle$ and $|1\rangle$:

$$ H|0\rangle = \tfrac{1}{\sqrt{2}}\begin{bmatrix} 1 & 1 \\ 1 & -1 \end{bmatrix}\begin{bmatrix} 1 \\ 0 \end{bmatrix} = \tfrac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \begin{bmatrix} 1 \\ 1 \end{bmatrix}= |+\rangle 
\quad \quad \quad \quad 
H|1\rangle = \tfrac{1}{\sqrt{2}}\begin{bmatrix} 1 & 1 \\ 1 & -1 \end{bmatrix}\begin{bmatrix} 0 \\ 1 \end{bmatrix} = \tfrac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \begin{bmatrix} 1 \\ -1 \end{bmatrix}= |-\rangle $$

The H gate can transform the state of the qubit between the X and Z bases. It performs a rotation around the Bloch vector `[1,0,1]' (the line between the x and z-axis).

Applying the sequence of gates `HZH' to any qubit state is equivalent to applying a single X-gate:

$$ H = \tfrac{1}{\sqrt{2}}\begin{bmatrix} 1 & 1 \\ 1 & -1 \end{bmatrix} \quad\quad  Z = \begin{bmatrix} 1 & 0 \\ 0 & -1 \end{bmatrix} \quad\quad  X = \begin{bmatrix} 0 & 1 \\ 1 & 0 \end{bmatrix} $$

\begin{equation*} 
\begin{split}
HZH & = \tfrac{1}{\sqrt{2}}\begin{bmatrix} 1 & 1 \\ 1 & -1 \end{bmatrix} \begin{bmatrix} 1 & 0 \\ 0 & -1 \end{bmatrix}\tfrac{1}{\sqrt{2}}\begin{bmatrix} 1 & 1 \\ 1 & -1 \end{bmatrix} \\
HZH & = \tfrac{1}{\sqrt{2}}\tfrac{1}{\sqrt{2}}\begin{bmatrix} 1 & 1 \\ 1 & -1 \end{bmatrix} \begin{bmatrix} 1 & 0 \\ 0 & -1 \end{bmatrix}\begin{bmatrix} 1 & 1 \\ 1 & -1 \end{bmatrix} \\
HZH & = \tfrac{1}{2}\begin{bmatrix} 1 & -1 \\ 1 & 1 \end{bmatrix}\begin{bmatrix} 1 & 1 \\ 1 & -1 \end{bmatrix}\\
HZH & = \tfrac{1}{2}\begin{bmatrix} 0 & 2 \\ 2 & 0 \end{bmatrix} \\
HZH & = \begin{bmatrix} 0 & 1 \\ 1 & 0 \end{bmatrix} \\
HZH & = X
\end{split}
\end{equation*}

The following circuit was written to verify this.

\begin{figure}[h]

    \caption{Circuit diagram of a Hadamard gate, followed by a Pauli-Z gate, followed by another Hadamard gate in series} 
    \label{fig:hzhCircuit}
\end{figure}

The resultant state of the qubit after being passed through the circuit shown in Figure \ref{fig:hzhCircuit} was observed using a Bloch sphere:

    \caption{Bloch sphere showing the state of the qubit after each gate is applied} 
    \label{fig:bSphereHZHGate}
\end{figure}

It is clear upon comparing the initial state (Figure \ref{fig:hzhGate1}) to the final state (Figure \ref{fig:hzhGate4}) that applying the sequence of gates: HZH has an identical effect to applying a single X gate (see Figure \ref{fig:xyGateBloc}).

\subsection{Multi-Qubit Gates}

\subsubsection{The CNOT Gate}
The CNOT gate is a conditional two-qubit gate that performs an X gate on the second qubit (target), if the state of the first qubit (control) is  $|1\rangle$.

A quantum circuit was created, where two qubits are entangled and the output was measured, shown in Figure \ref{fig:entangleMeasure}:

\begin{figure}[H]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=0.4\textwidth]{lab2/images/entangleMeasure.png}
    \captionsetup{font = it, labelfont = bf, width=.91\linewidth, justification=centering}
    \caption{Diagram of circuit for measuring entangled qubits} 
    \label{fig:entangleMeasure}
\end{figure}

Both qubits were initialised in state $|0\rangle$. The H gate transformed q$_0$ from state $|0\rangle$ into a superposition of state $|0\rangle$ and $|1\rangle$. This means that when measuring q$_0$, 50\% of the time the qubit will collapse into state $|0\rangle$, otherwise it will collapse into state $|1\rangle$. q$_0$ was then used as a control bit in a CNOT gate, meaning half of the time it transforms q$_1$ to state $|1\rangle$; the other half q$_1$ will remain unchanged in state $|0\rangle$. As a result, two possible outcomes are expected from this circuit:
\begin{itemize}
    \item 50\% of the time the output is expected to be in state $|00\rangle$
    \item 50\% of the time the output is expected to be in state $|11\rangle$
\end{itemize}

This circuit was simulated using the `Aer' simulator provided by qiskit, the results of which are shown in Figure \ref{fig:qiskitHistogram}. 49\% of the time the output was in state $|00\rangle$, and 51\% of the time the output was in state $|11\rangle$ -- not a 50/50 split as expected. This is discussed further in Section \ref{sec:comparison}. To determine a realistic response, IBM's quantum computer was used. The results, again, were not in complete agreement with the theory, shown in Figure \ref{fig:ibmHistogram}. An explanation for this can be found in Section~\ref{sec:discussion}.

\end{figure}

\section{Comparison of Results with Theory} \label{sec:comparison}
%Needs a breif read through
In general the results were consistent with the theoretical predictions; however, as soon as measurements were taken the outcomes were slightly different as expected. For example, the histogram shown in Figure \ref{fig:qiskitHistogram} shows a 49/51 split in results -- not 50/50 split as expected. The reason for this is because qubits are probabilistic; they have an element of randomness and as a result, their behaviour cannot be determined with 100\% accuracy. A further reason for the unexpected outcome is because the Aer simulator was used which introduces noise. Noise describes all of the things that cause interference in a quantum computer, such as interference from electromagnetic signals, or disturbances in the Earth’s magnetic field. When qubits in a quantum computer are exposed to this kind of noise the information gets degraded. The introduction of noise effected the qubits, causing it to collapse in not an exact 50/50 split. This can be improved by increasing the number of `shots' -- by increasing the number of times the simulation is run, the outcome is more likely to be closer to the probability stated by the mathematics -- however, some percentage of noise is unavoidable.

\section{Discussion} \label{sec:discussion}
\textbf{Question 1:}
\textit{Initialise a qubit, and apply the X gate to it. Confirm your result by drawing the circuit and visualising the flipped state using the Block sphere (use/copy and paste the examples above wherever appropriate).}

The circuit diagram of an X gate shown in Figure \ref{fig:xGate} with the Bloch sphere visualising states shown in Figure~\ref{fig:bSphereXGate}.

\textbf{Question 2:}
\textit{Apply the x and y gates to the qubit above and draw it on your screen.}

The circuit diagram of an X and Y gate is shown in Figure \ref{fig:xyGateDiagram} with the Bloch sphere visualising states shown in Figure~\ref{fig:xyGateBloc}.

\textbf{Question 3:}
\textit{Show mathematically that applying the sequence of gates: HZH, to any qubit state is equivalent to applying an X gate. Then, write a circuit that will show this (you can check each step/rotation, by plotting the new state on the Bloch Sphere each time.}

The mathematical proof can be found in Section \ref{sec:HZH}. The circuit diagram and Bloch sphere visualising the states are shown in Figure \ref{fig:hzhCircuit} and \ref{fig:bSphereHZHGate} respectively.

\textbf{Question 4:}
\textit{Build a 2-qubit quantum circuit where the 2 qubits are entangled and measure the output. Does this agree with the mathematical prediction? If not, why would you say that is so?}

The circuit diagram for measuring entangled qubits is shown in Figure \ref{fig:entangleMeasure}. The results did not agree with the mathematical prediction, as a 50/50 split was expected. The reasoning for this is discussed in Section \ref{sec:comparison}.

\textbf{Question 5:}
\textit{Use IBM composer and compare its results to what you obtained above. Are they different? How so? Is there anything you can do to make the results come closer to the mathematical expectation?}

The circuit shown in Figure \ref{fig:entangleMeasure} was implemented in IBM's quantum computer, the results of which can be found in Figure \ref{fig:ibmHistogram}. The final state was not 50/50 split between state $|00\rangle$ and $|11\rangle$ due to the unpredictable nature of qubits and also because of noise. Interestingly, the final state was occasionally found in state $|01\rangle$ and $|10\rangle$. This is because qubits are very fragile and are prone to quantum noise. Disturbances among qubits can corrupt the state and cause errors, such as bit-flip errors -- an error where the qubit's computational state flips from 1 to 0 or vice versa. This explains why occasionally, the system was measured to be in state $|01\rangle$ and $|10\rangle$. These errors can be reduced by employing error correction algorithms - a method of compensating for high error rates by spreading quantum information across many redundant qubits. QEC is used in quantum computing to protect quantum information from noise errors and can therefore be used to ensure correct data is achieve fault-tolerant quantum computation. 

Another reason for the error could be due to faulty measurements, as measurements generally disturb quantum systems. The disturbance caused by measurement depends on the details of the interaction between system and apparatus; this can generally be improved by increasing the number of shots.

\section{Conclusions}

In this lab, quantum circuits were implemented and visualised using qiskit. Through the use of circuit diagrams and Bloch spheres, a deeper understanding of quantum gates and quantum operations was achieved. The objectives were fulfilled with ease, therefore no changes are necessary to attain them.

The Bloch sphere helped visualise the function of all the quantum gates. The CNOT gate was used in conjuction with the H gate to entangle two qubits together. A greater understanding of quantum systems was achieved by comparing the results from qiskit to the results from an actual quantum computer. I believe this lab was an excellent introduction to quantum circuits as I now understand how quantum gates function and how they can be used to build simple quantum circuits.
