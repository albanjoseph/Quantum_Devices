\chapter{Quantum Teleportation}

In quantum teleportation, the properties of quantum entanglement are used to send a qubit between observers without physically moving the involved qubit. The qubits themselves are not really teleported, but the state of one qubit is destroyed on one side and extracted on the other side, so the information that the state encodes is communicated. The usefulness of quantum teleportation lies in its ability to send quantum information arbitrarily far distances without exposing quantum states to thermal decoherence from the environment or other adverse effects.

\section{Results} \label{sec:teleResults}
The following qubit state  $|\Psi \rangle = \alpha |0 \rangle + \beta |1 \rangle$ needs to be transferred. By taking advantage of two classical bits and an entangled qubit pair, the state $|\Psi \rangle$ can be transferred.

The following steps were followed to create an entanglement protocol and to perform quantum teleportation.

\textbf{Step 1:} Use a third party entangled qubit pair.

Qubit q1 and qubit q2 were entangled by applying CNOT gate after applying a Hadamard gate. These two qubits were used as the ``third party entangled qubit pair'', shown in Figure \ref{step1}

\end{figure}

\textbf{Step 2:} Perform operations on the qubit that must be sent.
q0 is the qubit that is required to be sent. It is initalised in a random state and then entangled with qubit q1 (one of the third party entangled pairs), shown in Figure \ref{step2}.

\textbf{Step 3:} Send the results over a classical communication channel.

The qubit being sent, q0, and one of the third party entangled pair qubits, q1, were measured, stored in classical bits, and sent over a classical communication channel, as can be seen in Figure \ref{step3}

\end{tabular}
\caption{Code and circuit diagram to send data over classical channel}
\label{step3}
\end{figure}

\textbf{Step 4:} Perform some operations on the received information to receive the qubit.

The classical bits were received and were used to determine what gates had to be applied to the other third party entangled qubit, q2. 
\begin{itemize}
    \item If 00 is received, then no gates are applied to qubit q2
    \item If 01 is received then an X gate is applied to qubit q2
    \item If 10 is received then a Z gate is applied to qubit q2
    \item If 11 is received then an X gate and a Z gate is applied to qubit q2 in series
\end{itemize}
The implementation can be seen in Figure \ref{step4}.

\subsubsection{Final Design}
The circuit written to perform `quantum teleportation' is shown in Figure \ref{fig:teleportCircuit}.
\begin{figure}[h]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=0.6\textwidth]{lab3/images/teleportCircuit.png}
    \caption{Circuit diagram to teleport qubit q0 to qubit q2, made using qiskit}
    \label{fig:teleportCircuit}
\end{figure}
Qubit q3 was initialised to be the same as qubit q0 (the qubit that is being quantum-mechanically teleported). This was done purely to ensure the same qubit was extracted. Qubit q2 is the qubit that was extracted after teleportation. It is clear that it is the same as qubit q3, thus proving the circuit worked. To verify the robustness of this design, the circuit was built using IBMs remote quantum computer. The result from which are discussed in Section \ref{sec:discussTeleport}.

\section{Comparison of Results with Theory}
\section{Discussion} \label{sec:discussTeleport}
\textbf{Question 1:}

Follow the steps above, and the knowledge of qiskit you now have from Lab 2 to create a teleportation protocol. You may also benefit from the little revision above which introduce a couple of new features of qiskit

Steps for teleportation protocol were followed and are discussed in Section \ref{sec:teleResults}. See Figure \ref{fig:teleportCircuit} for the final circuit diagram.

\textbf{Question 2:}

\textbf{2(a)}: Use IBM composer and compare its results to what you obtained above. Are they different? How so?

A circuit similar to the circuit shown in Figure \ref{fig:teleportCircuit} was implemented in the IBM Quantum Composer environment. The qubit that was required to be teleported was initialized in state $|0\rangle$ instead of a random state, the results are plotted in Figure \ref{fig:ibmHistogram}.

\end{figure}

\textbf{2(b):} Now that you have implemented it, what could quantum teleportation be used for and why is it important?

Quantum hardware is far less robust to errors as classical hardware since the slightest interaction with the environment causes a qubit to collapse into a discrete state of either 0 or 1. This phenomenon poses significant challenges to the dependability of quantum computers. Using quantum teleportation is extremely important for transferring quantum information especially when information needs to be sent over large distances as the information can be protected from noise.
Present-day state-of-the-art quantum computers typically suffer due to decoherence and noise in qubits, hence developing methods to improve the robustness of quantum systems, such as quantum teleportation, is therefore essential for many practical applications.
%demand less failure in  to be practical.  

\section{Conclusions}

In this lab a quantum algorithm was implemented and applied to successfully achieve quantum teleportation. This was first performed using qiskit, and the result was verified by retesting the circuit on IBMs quantum computer. Thus, the objectives were successfully fulfilled. The objectives were met with ease, so I do not believe the lab should be changed in any way to meet those objectives.
To improve understanding, it would be helpful to briefly discuss the quantum algorithm and how it is formed, i.e. the reasons for applying the gates in the given order. Although, having said that, it is understandable if that is outside the scope of this course.
